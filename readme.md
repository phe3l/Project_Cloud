# Indoor & Outdoor Weather Monitoring System

## üåê Project Overview
This project implements an indoor/outdoor weather monitoring system using an M5Stack IoT device integrated with various sensors. The system gathers data from indoor conditions and outdoor weather information via an API, presenting it through a cloud-based dashboard developed with Plotly Dash and on the M5Stack device screen. The M5Stack device also has the ability to say out loud weather conditions when specific criteria are met.

## ü§ñ M5Stack IoT Device

The M5Stack IoT device serves as a compact yet powerful sensor hub designed to collect environmental data both indoors and outdoors. It features a versatile interface that allows for real-time monitoring and interaction.

### üå°Ô∏è Functionalities:
- **Environmental Sensing**: Measures indoor temperature and humidity using an environmental sensor (ENV3).
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Monitors indoor air quality with a Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) gas detector, providing CO2 level readings.
- **Time and Date Management**: Synchronizes with an NTP server to maintain accurate time and date display, adapting to the local timezone.
- **Motion Detection**: Utilizes a Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor to detect presence and activity within the monitored area.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Displays real-time outdoor weather conditions and forecasts by integrating with weather APIs.
- **Historical Data Visualization**: Displays graphical representations of the last 7 days of historical data, including CO2 levels, indoor humidity, and temperature, fetched from BigQuery.
- **Connectivity**: Supports automatic Wi-Fi connections for reliable data transmission to cloud services and remote monitoring capabilities.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts for significant changes in environmental conditions, such as high humidity or poor air quality, and triggers visual alerts using light signals.
- **Voice Announcements**: Generates and plays spoken weather updates based on current weather data.
- **Data Transmission**: Sends real-time sensor data to a server for further processing and storage in BigQuery.
- **Offline Data Buffering**: Stores sensor data locally when offline and sends it to the server once the connection is reestablished.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Display Information:

The M5Stack screen provides real-time visual feedback of various environmental parameters and system statuses. Below is a detailed breakdown of the information displayed:

- **Date and Time**: The current date and time are displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Wi-Fi Status**: Indicates the status of the Wi-Fi connection:
  - `W+T`: Both Wi-Fi and time synchronization are successful.
  - `W-T`: Only Wi-Fi is connected.
  - `-W`: Wi-Fi is disconnected.
- **Motion Status**: Shows `M` when motion is detected and `NM` when no motion is detected.
- **Temperature**: Displays the current indoor temperature measured by the environmental sensor.
- **Humidity**: Displays the current indoor humidity level. If the humidity is greater than 60% or less than 40%, the text is displayed in red, and an LED alert is triggered.
- **Air Quality**: Shows the CO2 concentration in parts per million (ppm) as measured by the TVOC gas detector. If the CO2 level exceeds 1000 ppm, the text is displayed in red, and an LED alert is triggered.
- **Weather Information**: Displays images for current and future weather forecasts, fetched from a weather API and updated periodically.
- **Historical Data Visualization**: By pressing the B button (middle button on the M5Stack), an image displays graphical representations of the last 7 days of data, including CO2 levels, indoor humidity, and temperature. Press the B button again to return to the normal display.
- **Error Messages and Status Updates**: Shows any errors or important status updates to inform the user of the system's current state.
- **Pending Data Indicator**: Indicates the number of data points stored locally, which will be sent once the Wi-Fi connection is reestablished. This indicator is visible only when the Wi-Fi connection is lost.

### M5Stack Requirements

1. Required Hardware: M5Stack Core2, ENV3 Environmental Sensor, PIR Motion Sensor, TVOC Gas Detector.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on the M5Stack device.

### M5Stack Setup

1. Clone the project repository to the device (only the `dashboard_ui.py` file is needed).
2. Load the required images into the `res` folder on the M5Stack device. The images can be found in the `res` folder of the project repository:
   - `default_current_weather.png`
   - `default_future_weather.png`
   - `fetch-bigquery-history-image.png`
3. Configure the Wi-Fi credentials in the `dashboard_ui.py` script.
4. Run the `dashboard_ui.py` script to start the device interface.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Service

The backend service is the core of data management and interaction in our project, built using Flask. This service acts as a middleware to handle data storage, retrieval, and real-time data processing between the M5Stack IoT device and the cloud.

### üìà Functionalities:
- **Data Handling**: Manages the storage and retrieval of sensor data and weather information in Google's BigQuery.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Integrates with OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time and forecasted weather data based on user location derived from IP addresses.
- **Image Generation**: Creates visual representations of current and forecasted weather conditions.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts weather descriptions into spoken output, enhancing accessibility and user interaction.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/send-to-bigquery`: Receives and stores data into BigQuery.
  - `/current-weather`: Fetches and returns current weather data.
  - `/future-weather`: Provides future weather forecasts.
  - `/generate-weather-image`: Generates an image depicting the current weather, including temperature, humidity, and weather icons.
  - `/generate-future-weather-image`: Creates images showing future weather forecasts.
  - `/generate-current-weather-spoken`: Generates spoken weather descriptions from current weather data.
  - `/fetch-bigquery-history`: Retrieves historical weather data stored in BigQuery.
  - `/fetch-bigquery-history-image`: Visualizes historical weather data through dynamically generated graphs.
